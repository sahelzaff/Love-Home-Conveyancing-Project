From the time of introduction call with Robin, Both Sheila or Bonnie had attended to my matter with extreme professionalism and punctuality ( which is becoming rare these days ). They did very good job with care /considerations for two of my transactions! Not just for me. I had referred them to my friend and within 1 day they were able to review contract, provide guidance, do the required negotiations with vendor for the benefit of my friend. Will sure hire Love Homes in future."
